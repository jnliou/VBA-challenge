Module 2 Challenge: 
How to analyze generated stock market data within the years 2018-2020

Instructions:

If you open up "Module 2 - Challenge - VBA Codes", you can technically run the whole code at once, but I also separated the macros into 4 other separate files, separated by the data we analyzed.

Module 2 - Challenge -Ticker and Percentage and Total Volume - is the code that loops through the data and stores the values for the ticker symbol, volume of stock, open price, and close price, it creates columns for the ticker symptom, total stock volume, yearly change, and percentage change. 

It also does conditional formatting for the yearly change column (red and green columns based on values), and the percentage change column (adding % for each value).

Module 2 - Challenge -Greatest Percentage Increase, Decrease and Volume

Is the code that displays the Ticker and numeric values for the Greatest % Increase, Greatest % Decrease, and Greatest Total Volume. It also creates the titles for the tables for each worksheet. 

Module 2 - Challenge - Autofit

This VBA script autofits all the columns, to make the Excel spreadsheet look more visually appealing. It allows the titles to fully be seen. 

Module 2 - Challenge - Sub WorkBookLoop()
This is the VBA script which can run on all sheets successfully.

How do you run the code?

Please run the Module 2 - Challenge - Sub WorkBookLoop(), and it will call the other macros and run them accordingly.

Sceenshots:

I took screenshots for the Ticker, Percentage and Total Volume of each year, as well as the greatest percentage increase/decrease and total volume for each year, hence you'll see 2 screenshots of my results for each year. View my screenshots in the  Results - Screenshot folder.
